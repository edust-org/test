# Version 0.1.0: Initial Frontend

## Problem Statement

During the early stages of frontend development, we encountered the challenge of creating a flexible, feature-rich platform capable of handling multiple roles and providing tailored experiences for each type of user (students, teachers, institutions). We needed a UI that allowed users to easily register, authenticate, and manage their organizations, while also enabling the creation of public-facing websites with minimal friction. Additionally, the platform had to support dynamic content rendering, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time previews to meet the evolving needs of its users.

## The Decision to Use

To address these challenges, we decided to use **React.js** as the core library for building the user interface, due to its component-based architecture and state management capabilities. **TypeScript** was chosen for type safety and improved developer productivity, especially as the project scaled. We integrated **GrapesJS** as the site builder for its drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to design their organizationâ€™s websites easily.

Key components of the frontend architecture included:

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Leveraging form management for secure registration with social media login options (Google, GitHub).
- **Organization Management**: An admin dashboard where authenticated users could create and customize organizations.
- **Site Builder**: A flexible page builder with pre-built templates and real-time editing features for organization websites.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions Provided

### Jun 15, 2024

#### User Interface and Authentication Integration:

- **Problem**: Implementing secure and responsive user registration and authentication flows, especially when incorporating third-party providers like Google and GitHub.
- **Solution**:
  - We integrated **Firebase** for managing authentication ([5a9c4f6](https://github.com/edust-org/edust/commit/5a9c4f6)), ensuring a smooth login/signup process across multiple platforms.
  - Custom input validation and error handling were added to enhance user experience during form submissions.

#### Drag-and-Drop Site Builder:

- **Problem**: Developing a site builder tool that would allow organization owners to create and customize their public-facing sites without requiring coding skills.
- **Solution**:
  - We integrated **GrapesJS** ([7d0e12c](https://github.com/edust-org/edust/commit/7d0e12c)) into the frontend to allow drag-and-drop functionality for building pages, with pre-built templates tailored for educational organizations. This made it simple for users to customize their pages and see real-time previews.
  - We addressed mobile responsiveness by ensuring that all site templates were mobile-friendly and adapted seamlessly to different screen sizes.

#### Dashboard for Organization Management:

- **Problem**: Building a dashboard where users could manage their organizations, view statistics, and customize settings.
- **Solution**:

  - We developed a React component-based dashboard ([4b3f21a](https://github.com/edust-org/edust/commit/4b3f21a)) that offered a modular design. Each feature, such as organization management, was encapsulated in its own component, allowing for easy scalability and future enhancements.

- **Challenges**:
  Managing the state of complex forms and dynamic page elements was a major challenge. We employed **React Context** to handle global state and **Redux Toolkit** for managing more complex scenarios like real-time site edits, which ensured efficient communication between the dashboard and site builder.

### Conclusion

The initial version of the **Edust** successfully implemented a scalable and flexible user interface, offering a smooth experience for users to register, manage their organizations, and create public-facing websites. With the drag-and-drop site builder, mobile responsiveness, and real-time preview features, Edust set the foundation for a platform where education meets innovation, creating endless opportunities for growth and collaboration within the educational community.
