# Introduction

At [Edust Org](https://github.com/edust-org), our backend development involved creating a complex architecture that supports multiple features, including user authentication, organization management, role-based access control, and API documentation. The primary objective of the **Edust-Backend** was to build a scalable and modular backend system to power our educational platform, facilitating smooth interactions between students, teachers, and organizations.
