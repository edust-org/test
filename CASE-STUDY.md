# Introduction

At [Edust Org](https://github.com/edust-org), our backend development involved creating a complex architecture that supports multiple features, including user authentication, organization management, role-based access control, and API documentation. The primary objective of the **Edust-Backend** was to build a scalable and modular backend system to power our educational platform, facilitating smooth interactions between students, teachers, and organizations.

## Version 0.1.0: Initial Backend Setup

### Problem Statement

The primary challenge we faced in the early stages of backend development was setting up a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture for a growing set of features. Each new feature required creating models, controllers, services, and route handlers. This became cumbersome as more modules were added, and maintaining consistency became difficult. We needed a solution that allowed the development team to quickly scaffold new features, ensure adherence to coding standards, and efficiently manage role-based access.

### The Decision to Use

To address this, we chose **Express.js** as our backend framework with **TypeScript** for static typing, which helps in reducing bugs and enhancing code maintainability. We also adopted **Sequelize ORM** for database interactions to allow flexibility in switching between different databases like MySQL and MongoDB in the future.

We structured our backend to use the following components:

- **Routes**: For managing the API endpoints.
- **Controllers**: For handling the business logic.
- **Services**: For database and logic abstraction.
- **Middleware**: For common tasks like authentication and error handling.

### Challenges Faced and Solutions Provided

1. **User Authentication**:

   - **Problem**: We needed a secure authentication mechanism for both login and registration processes.
   - **Solution**: Implemented JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless user sessions. Users could log in via email and password, and the server would generate JWT tokens for subsequent API requests. The implementation was done using the commits [2ec994c](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/2ec994c) and [9bc8f55](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/9bc8f55).

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:

   - **Problem**: We needed a way to assign different roles (e.g., admin, user, organization owner) and restrict access to certain features based on roles.
   - **Solution**: Introduced a `Role` model in Sequelize to define different user roles and implemented middleware to check user permissions before allowing access to certain routes. This was implemented in commits like [f338b50](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/f338b50) and [385f912](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/385f912).

3. **Organization Management**:

   - **Problem**: Users needed the ability to create and manage organizations, such as educational institutions or colleges, with different role structures.
   - **Solution**: Developed an organization model and seed data to assign roles within organizations. Users could create organizations and invite others to join them, with permissions based on their role. This feature was tackled in commits like [d1c67a0](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/d1c67a0) and [81f9852](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/81f9852).

4. **API Documentation with Swagger**:

   - **Problem**: As the API grew, it became difficult for developers and external clients to understand the available endpoints and their required parameters.
   - **Solution**: Integrated Swagger for API documentation, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the API endpoints. This allowed for easier testing and understanding of the backend structure. Initial setup was done in commit [0945626](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/0945626).

5. **Global Error Handling**:
   - **Problem**: Without a centralized error-handling mechanism, errors could crash the server or go unnoticed.
   - **Solution**: Created global error handlers to catch and log all errors, providing appropriate HTTP responses to the client and preventing server crashes. This was implemented in commit [e1a908f](https://github.com/your-repo/commit/e1a908f).

### Conclusion

The initial version of the Edust-Backend established a scalable and modular architecture that allowed developers to easily create and manage new features. With the implementation of user authentication, role-based access control, organization management, and API documentation, we laid the foundation for a powerful and flexible backend system to support the growing needs of the Edust platform.
